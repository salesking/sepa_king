## Examples

How to create a SEPA File. Also check out the specs to have a running example of an export.

```ruby
# Build a new SEPA file for Direct Debit
sepa = SEPA::DirectDebitInitiation.new

# set sender account
sepa.account = SEPA::Account.new(
                    :bank_account_number => "123456789",
                    :bank_number => "69069096",
                    :owner_name => "Return to Sender",
                    :bank_name => "Money Burner Bank")

# following should be done in a loop to add multiple bookings
# create receiving account
receiver = SEPA::Account.new(
                    :bank_account_number => "987456123",
                    :bank_number => "99099096",
                    :owner_name => "Gimme More Lt.",
                    :bank_name => "Banking Bandits")
# create booking
booking = SEPA::Booking.new(receiver, 100.00 )

# set booking text if you want to
booking.text = "Thanks for your purchase"

# add booking
sepa.add( booking )
# end loop

# create XML string and do with it whatever fits your workflow
xml_string = sepa.generate_xml
```
